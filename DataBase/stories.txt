The Little Seed's Big Trip

Hey Hasan, listen to this story!
Once, a tiny seed felt scared.
"I'm stuck!" it cried.
"I want to travel far!"
Then, wind came, whoosh, strong.
It blew the seed away, high.
You see, seeds travel by wind.
Like when you blow dandelions!
The seed landed near a river.
It grew roots, drank water.
The seed became a tall tree!
It gave shade to all.
See Hasan, small things grow big.
Just like you will!

Jamil and the Little Seed

Hey Jamil, listen to this!
Once, there was a tiny seed.
It lived underground, all alone.
"I want to see the sun!" it said.
So, it pushed up through the dirt.
You know, like when you play outside!
The seed grew into a flower.
Bees came and made honey there.
The flower helped the world grow.
Just like you help by being kind.
Even small things matter, Jamil.
Like seeds and you, my friend.
So, always try your best to bloom!
The world is waiting to see you grow.

The Whispering Tree

Hey Hasan, listen to this!
Once upon a time, far away.
There was a big, old tree.
It stood all alone on a hill.
People said it whispered secrets.
No one knew what it said.
A little girl named Lily came.
She sat under its branches.
She listened very carefully.
The tree whispered, "Be kind, Hasan."
Lily smiled, very happy now.
She understood the tree's mystery.
Kindness is a magic for everyone.
Share it, like the tree shared peace.
